          <h2>About</h2>
          <p>I am currently taking classes at Seattle University to become a certified web developer. I am self-motivated and I genuinely view coding as an opportunity to harness my skills, not as a chore. I started classes at Seattle University on the web development track in January. Before that, I did an extensive search looking for the perfect "coding school". I have attended numerous orientations for bootcamps. I feel proud and grateful that I found the Seattle U program. The robust curriculum builds a strong foundation for students to excel as web developers. It is not only about learning web technologies and learning how to code. It is about learning these skills in context of how it impacts consumers. Detailed course desctiption including links to the Seattle University Website are in the "Education" section. This webpage was created specifically to offer my skills in a new area of focus: a position in between web developer intern and entry level web developer. (Based on the current openings list on your website) This part-time web developer position would be a balance of duties between the two. See the "details" section for more information about this position.<p>

          <h2>Skills</h2>
          <p>The past jobs I've held have been primarily in adminstration and retail. Skills from these industries do not directly translate to the skills needed for a web developer. However, I still gained useful skills and experience from those jobs.</p>
          <ul>General Skills
            <li>Over 3+ years of customer service. I am comfortable talking to people in a pleasant, professional manner. I am comfortable resolving conflicts with customers.</li>
            <li>Teamwork. I have experience working in small teams and coordinating with people in order to create an effiecient and transparent work environment.</li>
            <li>Organization. At my current job I have to manage various orders, filing, and tasks for a group of people. This forces me to be organized, things have to be ordered on time without gaps in supplies and my workspace has to be clear so other people can easily navigate it.</li>
            <li>Avid, Passionate learner. I am a patient student and I see obstacles as an opportunity to learn. Working on class projects and practicing programming on my own is exciting to me.</li>
            <li>Good Communication Skills: Active Listener. I make a conscious effort to fulling listen to information before responding. This allows me to understand the complete message that is communicated. </li>
          </ul>
          <ul>Technical Skills
            <li>Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign</li>
            <li>Photography</li>
            <li>HTML5, CSS3</li>
            <li>Version Control: Git, Github</li>
            <li>Social Media: Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Tumblr</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Details</h2>
          <p>Proposed Rate of Pay: $20-30/hr. Weekly Commitment: 25-35hrs. Rate of pay is based on fact that I am a non-traditional student. I have a degree in Graphic Design and Photography which can be directly applied to my work as a trainee web developer. I am over the traditional intern age and I support myself. Proposed weekly commitment is under 40 hours. It is flexible because I anticipate that some weeks may be busier or slower than others. Every minute of my time spent at Efelle will be used productively. For example, if there is nothing to work on programming wise I am open to taking on administrative or creative tasks. I noticed "Agency Life" section of your website is empty. Because I also studied photography I could create content for that by creating images for that page. I am adaptable and it is easy for me to step into different roles as needed. I have a well-rounded set of skills outside of programming that I could apply to this position at Efelle.</p>

        <h2>Social Impact</h2>
        <p>I noticed immediately that your firm has a diverse work environment. I am passionate about programming and about breaking the mold of what a traditional developer is. The <a href="https://medium.com/the-coffeelicious/you-may-have-seen-my-face-on-bart-8b9561003e0f#.ldahherqm">#ILookLikeanEngineer</a> hashtag was launched to challenge common misconceptions about who engineers are.The hashtag grew in popularity as women and people of color used it to share their experiences in an industry that is traditonally run by mostly white and Asian men. These types of social movements personally resonate with me and I look forward to redefining the parameters of what a programmer/ web developer an look like. I believe this passion aligns with Efelle's progressive work culture values.</p>
