          <h2>Skills</h2>
          <p>The past jobs I've held have been primarily in adminstration and retail. Skills from these industries do not directly translate to the skills needed for a web developer. However, I still posess useful skills and experience because of this. See examples below:</p>
          <ul>General Skills
            <li>Over 3+ years of customer service. I am comfortable talking to people in a pleasant, professional manner. I am comfortable resolving conflicts with customers.<li>
            <li>Teamwork. I have experience working in small teams and coordinating with people in order to create an effiecient and transparent work environment.</li>
            <li>Organization. At my current job I have to manage various orders, filing, and tasks for a group of people. This forces me to be organized, things have to be ordered on time without gaps in supplies and my workspace has to be clear so other people can easily navigate it.</li>
            <li>Avid, Passionate learner. I love learning about web development. I don't get frustrated easily and I see every obstacle as an opportunity to learn. Working on class projects and practicing programming on my own is exciting to me.</li>
            <li>active listener-give examples</li>
          </ul>
          <ul>Technical Skills
            <li>Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign</li>
            <li>Photography</li>
            <li>HTML5, CSS3</li>
            <li>Version Control: Git, Github</li>
            <li>Markdown</li>
          </ul>      
      </section>

          <h2>Details</h2>
          <p>Proposed Rate of Pay: $20-30/hr. Weekly Commitment: 25-35hrs. Rate of pay is based on fact that I am a non-traditional student. I already have a degree and one of the subjects (Graphic Design) can be directly applied to my work as a trainee web developer. I am over the traditional intern age and I support myself, I am not supported by my parents. Proposed weekly commitment is under 40 hours. This is so I am able to spend more time on making great projects in my schoolwork. It is flexible since some weeks may be busier or slower than others. Every minute of my paid time will be put to good use. For example, if there is nothing to work on programming wise I am open to taking on administrative or creative tasks. I noticed "Agency Life" section of your website is empty. Because I also studied photography I could create content for that in the way of photography.</p>

        <h2>Social Impact</h2>
        <p>I noticed that you have a lot of women looking at your firm. You're probably already aware of the imbalance in the web development industry of men to women and white/Asian people to any other race. I am enthusistic about breaking that mold of what a developer is. Social movements like "#ILookLikeanEngineer" particularly resonate with me and I am eager to contribute to a field in which I am not well represented.</p>
